## Features
- Privacy Preserving Immunity Passport through Zero Knowledge 
- Scalable Immunity Data Acquisition through Chainlink Oracle
- Empathy Centric End User Engagement through Experience Design
- ERC-20 Tokens for the Immunity Passport Tokenisation
- Chainlink Verifiable Random Functions for the Immunity Indexing
- Chainlink Oracles for the Immunity Data Collection
- Immunity Proof Construction through Iden3 Circom Compilers
- Immunity Proof Verification through Iden3 SnarkJS Library
- Immunity Proof Smart Contracts through zk-SNARK Smart Contracts
- Immunity Decentralised Autonomous Organisation as a RANDAO
- Immunity Passport Proof Indexing through Chainlink VRF
- Immunity Passport Registration through Proof of Authority Consensus
- Immunity Passport Token Sharing through Proof of Stake Consensus

## Workflow
- Immunity Passport Data Collection from Chainlink Oracle Contracts that integrates Blockchain to the Big Data in the Physical World
- Immunity Proof Construction in a Privacy Preserving Manner using Zero Knowledge Proofs based on the Data Collected by Immunity Oracles
- Immunity Proofs and Immunity Oracle Data is used to generate an ERC-20 Token and a Dynamic DAO for the Immunity Passport Governance
- Decentralised Autonomous Organisation is Governed through the Immunity Proof and Oracles by applying the proof of authority consensus
- Token Distribution through the proof of stake consensus for the token holders to securely stake immuniity passport rewards and benefits
