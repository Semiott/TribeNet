## Features
- Privacy Preserving Immunity Passport through Zero Knowledge 
- Scalable Immunity Data Acquisition through Chainlink Oracle
- Empathy Centric End User Engagement through Experience Design
- ERC-20 Tokens for the Immunity Passport Tokenisation
- Chainlink Verifiable Random Functions for the Immunity Indexing
- Chainlink Oracles for the Immunity Data Collection
- Immunity Proof Construction through Iden3 Circom Compilers
- Immunity Proof Verification through Iden3 SnarkJS Library
- Immunity Proof Smart Contracts through zk-SNARK Smart Contracts
- Immunity Decentralised Autonomous Organisation as a RANDAO
- Immunity Passport Proof Indexing through Chainlink VRF
- Immunity Passport Registration through Proof of Authority Consensus
- Immunity Passport Token Sharing through Proof of Stake Consensus

## Workflow
- Immunity Passport Data Collection from Chainlink Oracle Contracts through integration with the data feeds.
- Immunity Proof Construction in a Privacy Preserving Methods using ZKP based from Oracle Data Contracts
- Immunity Proofs and Oracle Data to generate ERC-20 Tokens and DAO for the Immunity Passport Governance
- Immunity Tokens Governed by Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAO) built using Chainlink VRF
- Immunity Token DAO is Governed through the the proof of authority consensus
- Immunity Token Distribution through the proof of stake consensus to securely stake rewards and benefits
